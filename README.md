# Blog Platform - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This repository contains a use-case design and implementation structure for a Blog Platform developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the design and modeling of a blog platform while adhering to OOP paradigms.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Users can register and log in.
  - Role-based access (Admin, Author, Reader).

- **Blog Management**:
  - Admin can manage blog categories and tags.
  - Authors can create, edit, and delete blog posts.

- **Content Interaction**:
  - Readers can view blogs, leave comments, and like posts.
  - Pagination for blog lists.

- **UML Diagrams**:
  - Use-case diagram illustrating the interactions between users and the system.
  - Class diagram showing the structure of the platform.
